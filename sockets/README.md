# Socket.io in Node.js

Haven't done sockets in a while so this is a refresher. Run:

``` $ node server.js ```

Then load up [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/) in a browser. If you click the button you'll see
the server output an incremented count the client is sending to the server via a WebSocket connection.
